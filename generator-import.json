Platforms like Instagram and Facebook allow us to share important moments instantly, bridging distances that once seemed impossible to cross. Young people especially benefit from these tools, as they can maintain friendships across different schools and cities. The ability to video chat with relatives who live far away has strengthened family bonds in ways previous generations never experienced. Social media has truly made the world a smaller, more connected place.\n\nText 2\nWhile social media promises connection, it often delivers the opposite. Many users report feeling more isolated despite having hundreds of online \"friends.\" The constant comparison with others' carefully curated posts leads to anxiety and low self-esteem, particularly among teenagers. Face-to-face conversations are becoming rarer as people prefer texting or commenting online. Real relationships require genuine interaction, not just likes and shares. Instead of bringing us together, social media may actually be driving us apart emotionally and socially.",

When everyone dresses the same, students focus more on learning rather than comparing outfits or feeling self-conscious about their appearance. Uniforms also reduce morning stress for families, as parents and children don't need to debate what to wear each day. Additionally, uniforms can help schools maintain a professional atmosphere that supports academic achievement and reduces distractions in the classroom environment.\n\nText 2\n\nWhile school uniforms may seem beneficial, they actually limit students' ability to express their individuality and creativity. Young people naturally want to show their personality through their clothing choices, and uniforms suppress this important form of self-expression. Furthermore, uniforms can be expensive for families, especially when schools require specific brands or styles. Rather than solving problems, uniforms may create new financial burdens while failing to address the real issues that affect student learning and school culture.",

These gardens allow residents to grow their own vegetables and fruits, providing healthy food options that might otherwise be expensive or unavailable. Beyond nutrition, community gardens create social connections among neighbors who work together to maintain the shared space. They also beautify vacant lots and provide green spaces in concrete-heavy environments.\n\nText 2\nWhile community gardens offer many benefits, they also present challenges that cities must address. Maintaining these gardens requires ongoing commitment from volunteers, and participation often declines over time.

By eliminating weather dependency and reducing transportation costs, vertical farms can produce fresh vegetables year-round in city centers. This technology addresses food security concerns while minimizing environmental impact through reduced pesticide use and water conservation. As urban populations continue to grow, vertical farming offers a sustainable solution for feeding metropolitan areas efficiently.\n\nText 2\nWhile vertical farming shows promise, significant challenges remain before widespread adoption becomes feasible. The initial construction costs are enormous, often exceeding traditional farming investments by 400%. Additionally, the energy consumption required for LED lighting systems creates a substantial carbon footprint that may offset environmental benefits. Current vertical farms can only grow certain crops economically, limiting their agricultural impact. Until these technological and economic barriers are addressed, vertical farming will likely remain a niche solution rather than a comprehensive answer to global food production needs.",

However, recent research suggests that wild bees—including bumblebees, mason bees, and leafcutter bees—are actually more efficient pollinators for many crops than honeybees. These native species demonstrate superior pollen transfer rates and show greater resilience to environmental stressors. Rather than focusing exclusively on honeybee conservation, agricultural policy should prioritize creating habitats that support diverse wild bee populations, which could provide more robust and sustainable pollination services.\n\nText 2\n\nWhile wild bees undoubtedly contribute to ecosystem health, the commercial beekeeping industry remains irreplaceable for large-scale agriculture. Honeybees can be transported to pollinate crops across vast distances, providing targeted pollination services when and where farmers need them most. The managed nature of honeybee colonies allows for precise timing and density control that wild bee populations cannot match. Moreover, the economic infrastructure built around commercial beekeeping—from equipment manufacturing to honey production—supports thousands of livelihoods and represents billions in agricultural value that cannot simply be abandoned.",

This flexibility enables individuals to pursue passion projects while maintaining financial stability, fostering creativity and entrepreneurial spirit. The elimination of rigid corporate hierarchies allows talent to flourish based on merit rather than seniority, creating more equitable opportunities for advancement.\n\nPassage 2\nWhile the gig economy offers apparent flexibility, it systematically dismantles the social safety net that traditional employment provides. Workers sacrifice essential benefits like health insurance, retirement contributions, and paid leave for the illusion of independence. The unpredictable income streams create financial instability, forcing workers to accept lower wages and longer hours to compensate for uncertainty.

      "content": "Text 1\n\nThe widespread adoption of renewable energy technologies has been heralded as a crucial step toward reducing carbon emissions. However, the transition presents complex challenges that extend beyond simple technological implementation. Solar and wind power, while environmentally beneficial, introduce variability into electrical grids that were designed for consistent, predictable power sources. This intermittency requires sophisticated grid management systems and often necessitates backup power sources during periods of low renewable generation. Additionally, the geographic distribution of optimal renewable resources—abundant sunshine in desert regions, strong winds in coastal and elevated areas—frequently misaligns with population centers where energy demand is highest, creating transmission challenges that require substantial infrastructure investments.\n\nText 2\n\nA recent analysis of Germany's energy transition, known as the Energiewende, reveals both the promise and pitfalls of rapid renewable adoption. Despite achieving remarkable success in expanding renewable capacity, Germany has experienced some of the highest electricity prices in Europe, partly due to the costs associated with grid modernization and renewable energy subsidies. The country has also faced periods of grid instability, particularly during the winter months when solar generation is minimal and wind patterns are unpredictable. These challenges have led to increased reliance on energy imports from neighboring countries and, paradoxically, occasional increases in coal power generation to maintain grid stability.\n\nChart: Germany's Energy Mix and Electricity Prices (2010-2020)\n\n[THIS IS CHART: A dual-axis chart showing:\n- Left axis: Percentage of electricity from renewables (rising from 17% in 2010 to 46% in 2020)\n- Right axis: Average electricity price in cents per kWh (rising from 23.7 cents in 2010 to 31.4 cents in 2020)\n- The renewable percentage shows steady growth with some fluctuations\n- Electricity prices show consistent upward trend with steeper increases after 2015]",

This dichotomous framework suggests that optimal decisions emerge when System 2 overrides System 1's propensity for cognitive biases. Consequently, educational interventions emphasizing metacognitive awareness and systematic reasoning protocols have proliferated, predicated on the assumption that enhanced deliberation invariably yields superior outcomes across diverse domains of human judgment.\n\nPassage 2\nRecent empirical investigations challenge the presumptive superiority of deliberative reasoning, revealing that intuitive processes often demonstrate remarkable accuracy in complex environments. Expert radiologists, for instance, frequently exhibit superior diagnostic performance when relying on immediate visual impressions rather than exhaustive analytical protocols. This phenomenon, termed \"thin-slice\" judgment, suggests that extensive experience cultivates sophisticated pattern recognition capabilities that transcend conscious deliberation. Moreover, deliberative processes may paradoxically impair performance in domains requiring rapid integration of multifaceted information, indicating that the cognitive architecture optimizes differently across varying contextual demands.",

While historians have long celebrated the period's innovations—steam engines, mechanized textile production, and expanded transportation networks—recent scholarship reveals a more nuanced understanding of industrialization's ecological impact. \"The transformation of Britain's landscape during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries represented not merely economic development, but an unprecedented disruption of natural systems,\" argues environmental historian Sarah Mitchell in her groundbreaking study. Factory emissions poisoned rivers with unprecedented levels of chemical runoff, while coal consumption increased by 400% between 1780 and 1830, fundamentally altering atmospheric composition. Manchester, once renowned for its pristine countryside, became what contemporary observer William Cobbett described as \"a great wen\"—a malignant growth upon the landscape. The social reformer Friedrich Engels documented how \"the air of Manchester is thick and heavy with the smoke of a hundred factory chimneys,\" creating respiratory ailments that disproportionately affected working-class populations. Moreover, deforestation accelerated dramatically as timber demands for construction and fuel depleted ancient woodlands at rates exceeding natural regeneration by nearly tenfold.

However, recent empirical findings challenge this reductive framework, suggesting instead that consciousness may be a fundamental property of the universe itself, akin to mass or charge. Dr. Giulio Tononi's Integrated Information Theory (IIT) proposes that consciousness corresponds to integrated information, or Φ (phi), which can theoretically exist in any system capable of integrating information. \"The theory predicts that consciousness is not unique to biological brains but could emerge in artificial systems or even simple networks,\" Tononi explains. Meanwhile, quantum physicist Roger Penrose argues that \"quantum coherence in microtubules within neurons creates the substrate for consciousness, linking it to the fundamental quantum structure of reality.\" Perhaps most provocatively, panpsychist philosopher Philip Goff contends that \"consciousness is not produced by complex arrangements of matter but is rather an intrinsic feature of matter itself, present even at the level of elementary particles.\" Critics dismiss these theories as speculative, noting that \"current neuroscientific evidence overwhelmingly supports the view that consciousness is an emergent property of neural activity, with no need for exotic quantum effects or panpsychist assumptions.\" Nevertheless, the accumulating anomalies in consciousness research—such as the persistence of awareness during clinical death experiences and the apparent unity of consciousness despite the brain's distributed processing—suggest that our materialist paradigm may be fundamentally incomplete.",

Dr. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, explains that \"people can't multitask very well, and when people say they can, they're deluding themselves. The brain is very good at deluding itself.\" Studies consistently show that attempting to perform multiple tasks simultaneously actually decreases overall efficiency. In one landmark experiment, participants who switched between tasks took up to 25% longer to complete their work compared to those who focused on one task at a time. Furthermore, the quality of work suffered significantly during multitasking conditions. Brain imaging studies reveal that when we think we're multitasking, we're actually rapidly switching our attention between tasks, a process that creates mental fatigue and increases the likelihood of errors. As cognitive psychologist Dr. David Meyer notes, \"Even brief mental blocks created by shifting between tasks can cost as much as 25% of the time needed to complete a project.\" The evidence is clear: despite our intuitions, focusing on one task at a time remains the most effective approach to productivity.",

      "content": "The notion that creativity diminishes with age has been largely debunked by recent psychological research. While it's true that certain cognitive abilities like processing speed may decline over time, the creative process itself often becomes more refined and purposeful in later years. Dr. Sarah Chen's longitudinal study of 500 artists over two decades found that participants over 60 produced work that was rated as more emotionally resonant and technically sophisticated than their earlier pieces. \"The artists in our study didn't lose their creative edge,\" Chen notes. \"Instead, they developed a deeper understanding of their craft and a clearer vision of what they wanted to express.\" Furthermore, neurological studies reveal that older adults often exhibit increased bilateral brain activation during creative tasks, suggesting they draw upon a broader network of neural resources. The stereotype of the young, tortured artist may make for compelling narratives, but it doesn't reflect the reality of how creativity actually develops across the human lifespan. As Chen's research demonstrates, age can be an asset rather than an obstacle in the creative process.",

First, the rapid spread of books led to information overload, as people struggled to process the sudden abundance of available texts. Additionally, the printing press threatened traditional scribes and copyists, who found their livelihoods at risk as machines could produce books far more quickly and cheaply than human hands.\n\nHowever, solutions to these challenges gradually emerged. To address information overload, scholars developed new systems for organizing and categorizing knowledge, including improved library catalogs and academic disciplines. Meanwhile, many displaced scribes adapted by becoming editors, proofreaders, or book sellers, finding new roles in the expanding publishing industry. Furthermore, governments and institutions established regulations to ensure the quality and accuracy of printed materials.\n\nAs a result of these adaptations, the printing press ultimately transformed society in positive ways, making knowledge more accessible to ordinary people and accelerating the spread of literacy throughout Europe.",

They often find themselves overwhelmed by multiple assignments, social activities, and new responsibilities. However, there are several effective strategies that can help students take control of their schedules. First, creating a weekly planner allows students to visualize their commitments and deadlines. This simple tool helps them see when they have free time and when they need to focus on specific tasks. Second, breaking large projects into smaller, manageable steps makes overwhelming assignments feel less daunting. Instead of viewing a research paper as one massive task, students can divide it into stages like choosing a topic, gathering sources, creating an outline, and writing individual sections. Finally, learning to say no to some social invitations is crucial for maintaining academic priorities. While social connections are important, students must balance fun activities with their educational goals. By implementing these three strategies, college students can reduce stress and improve their academic performance.",

While the energy expenditure required to produce light might seem disadvantageous in an environment where calories are scarce, recent research suggests that this apparent paradox resolves when we consider the unique selective pressures of the abyssal zone. Dr. Elena Vasquez's team discovered that organisms capable of bioluminescence showed significantly higher reproductive success rates than their non-luminescent relatives, even when controlling for other factors such as size and metabolic efficiency. Intriguingly, the correlation between light production and reproductive success was strongest in regions where prey density was lowest—precisely where one would expect energy conservation to be most critical. The team's analysis of stomach contents revealed that bioluminescent species had access to prey items that were consistently larger and more nutritious than those consumed by non-luminescent species. Furthermore, mating behaviors observed through deep-sea cameras showed that bioluminescent displays preceded successful reproduction in 94% of recorded instances, compared to only 23% for non-luminescent courtship attempts. These findings suggest that in the resource-limited deep ocean, the metabolic cost of bioluminescence may be offset by advantages that are not immediately apparent from surface-level analysis.",

Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), first identified in 2006, has devastated honeybee colonies across North America and Europe, with some regions reporting losses of up to 40% annually. This phenomenon occurs when worker bees mysteriously abandon their hives, leaving behind the queen, larvae, and honey stores.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to this alarming trend. Pesticide exposure, particularly from neonicotinoids used in agriculture, has been shown to impair bees' navigation systems and weaken their immune responses. Additionally, habitat loss due to urbanization and monoculture farming practices has reduced the diversity of flowering plants that bees depend on for nutrition. Climate change further exacerbates these problems by altering blooming cycles and creating unpredictable weather patterns that disrupt foraging behaviors.\n\nFortunately, various solutions are being implemented to address this crisis. Many countries have begun restricting or banning harmful pesticides, while farmers are increasingly adopting bee-friendly practices such as planting cover crops and maintaining wildflower strips along field margins. Urban beekeeping programs have also emerged, transforming city rooftops and parks into pollinator havens. Furthermore, researchers are developing disease-resistant bee varieties and exploring innovative hive management techniques to strengthen colony resilience.",

This adaptive response, while often unsuccessful in extreme conditions, demonstrates that corals possess sophisticated regulatory mechanisms that allow them to attempt environmental adjustments. Furthermore, some coral species have shown remarkable resilience by developing heat tolerance over successive generations, suggesting an evolutionary capacity for adaptation that scientists are only beginning to understand.

      "content": "The ancient art of origami, the Japanese practice of paper folding, has experienced a remarkable transformation in recent decades. What began as a traditional craft has evolved into a sophisticated field that bridges art, mathematics, and engineering. Modern origami artists create incredibly complex designs that would have been unimaginable to earlier practitioners. These contemporary works often require hundreds of precise folds and can take weeks to complete. More importantly, the mathematical principles underlying origami have found practical applications in fields ranging from space technology to medical device design. NASA engineers have used origami concepts to design solar panels that fold compactly for space travel, while medical researchers have applied folding techniques to create tiny devices that can be inserted into the human body and then expand to perform their functions.",

Recent scientific studies have demonstrated that goldfish possess far more sophisticated cognitive abilities than previously thought. In a landmark experiment conducted at Plymouth University, researchers trained goldfish to navigate through underwater mazes, with the fish successfully remembering the correct path for weeks after initial training. \"The goldfish were able to recall the maze layout and consistently choose the correct route even after a month-long break from training,\" reported Dr. Sarah Chen, the lead researcher. Additionally, goldfish have been observed responding to different musical tones, with some fish showing preferences for classical music over rock. Pet goldfish often recognize their owners' faces and will swim excitedly toward the glass when their regular caretaker approaches, while remaining still when strangers are present. These behaviors clearly indicate that goldfish can form lasting memories and develop emotional attachments. The three-second memory myth likely persists because it conveniently justifies keeping these animals in small, unstimulating environments.",

The butterflies that typically arrived at the overwintering sites in central Mexico by late October were appearing nearly three weeks earlier than usual. More intriguingly, these early arrivals seemed to be in better physical condition—their wing coloration was more vibrant, and they carried more fat reserves than the monarchs from previous years. Rodriguez initially suspected that favorable weather conditions along the migration route might explain the phenomenon. However, when she examined meteorological data from the same period, she found that the butterflies had actually encountered more storms and headwinds than in typical years. The mystery deepened when she discovered that several other research teams across different flyways were reporting similar observations. Rodriguez began to wonder if the monarchs were adapting their behavior in response to something entirely different—perhaps the increasingly unpredictable timing of seasonal changes was forcing them to depart earlier from their northern breeding grounds to ensure they reached their destination before winter weather set in.",

She had spent three months authenticating what the dealer claimed was a lost work by the Renaissance polymath Giovanni Mercator—not the famous cartographer, but his lesser-known nephew who had pursued natural philosophy in the shadow of his uncle's geographic achievements. The handwriting matched samples from Mercator's verified correspondence, the paper bore the correct watermarks for 16th-century Venetian mills, and the chemical analysis of the ink revealed the precise iron-gall composition used by scholars of that era.\n\nYet something nagged at Dr. Hartwell. The treatise purported to describe a series of botanical experiments conducted in 1547, detailing the cultivation of New World crops—maize, tomatoes, and potatoes—in European soil. The methodology was sophisticated, the observations acute, and the conclusions remarkably prescient about plant adaptation. Too prescient, perhaps. While Spanish conquistadors had indeed brought these crops to Europe by the mid-16th century, widespread cultivation and systematic study remained decades away. The treatise described techniques that wouldn't be developed until the late 1600s, and its understanding of plant physiology seemed to anticipate discoveries that wouldn't occur until the 18th century.\n\nDr. Hartwell closed the manuscript and reached for her phone. The dealer would not be pleased with her assessment, but scholarly integrity demanded nothing less than absolute honesty about her findings.",

For centuries, visitors had admired what they believed to be Michelangelo's deliberately muted palette—earth tones and subdued hues that seemed to reflect the solemnity of the sacred space. The restoration team, led by chief restorer Gianluigi Colalucci, methodically removed layers of grime, candle soot, and previous restoration attempts that had accumulated over four and a half centuries. What emerged was a riot of brilliant blues, vibrant oranges, and luminous flesh tones that seemed almost jarring to eyes accustomed to the darkened masterpiece. Some critics argued that the cleaning had stripped away subtle glazes that Michelangelo himself had applied to achieve specific atmospheric effects. However, extensive analysis of paint samples and comparison with Michelangelo's other works from the same period—particularly his paintings on wood panels that had been better preserved—revealed remarkably similar color choices and techniques. The controversy gradually subsided as scholars recognized that their long-held assumptions about Michelangelo's artistic intentions had been shaped not by the artist's original vision, but by centuries of environmental damage and well-intentioned but misguided previous restoration efforts.",

While Wallace is celebrated today for independently conceiving the theory of evolution by natural selection, his letters from the 1860s onward increasingly focused on spiritualism and psychic phenomena. Critics have long dismissed this later work as an unfortunate departure from scientific rigor. However, recent scholarship suggests that Wallace's embrace of spiritualism was not a betrayal of his scientific method but rather its logical extension. Wallace applied the same empirical approach to investigating séances and mediums that he had used to study beetles in the Amazon. He meticulously documented observations, controlled for variables, and sought reproducible results. His contemporaries in the scientific establishment, however, refused to engage with his spiritualist research on methodological grounds, arguing that such phenomena lay beyond the purview of legitimate scientific inquiry. This institutional resistance persisted despite Wallace's insistence that he was merely following evidence wherever it led—the very principle that had guided his revolutionary work in evolutionary biology.",

These phenomena occur when urban areas experience significantly warmer temperatures than their rural surroundings, primarily due to human activities and infrastructure. The replacement of natural vegetation with concrete and asphalt surfaces creates areas that absorb and retain heat more effectively than natural landscapes. Additionally, energy consumption from buildings, transportation, and industrial activities contributes substantial waste heat to the urban environment. The consequences extend beyond mere discomfort, affecting energy consumption, air quality, and public health. Cities worldwide are implementing various mitigation strategies, including increasing green spaces, using reflective building materials, and promoting energy-efficient technologies.\n\nText 2\n\nA recent study examined temperature variations across different neighborhoods in Phoenix, Arizona, during summer months. Researchers measured average daily maximum temperatures at multiple locations throughout the metropolitan area. The findings revealed striking disparities: affluent neighborhoods with extensive tree coverage and larger lot sizes averaged 3-5°F cooler than low-income areas with minimal vegetation and higher building density. Industrial zones showed the most extreme temperatures, reaching up to 8°F above the regional average. Conversely, areas near large parks and the few remaining agricultural zones within the city limits recorded temperatures nearly matching those of rural areas outside Phoenix.

Dr. Elena Marchetti's longitudinal study of bilingual speakers demonstrates that while linguistic structures may influence certain cognitive tendencies—particularly in domains like spatial reasoning and color categorization—they do not constitute insurmountable barriers to thought. Rather than imprisoning cognition, language appears to function more as a \"cognitive tool\" that can facilitate or inhibit particular types of thinking without fundamentally altering the underlying architecture of human reasoning.

The cutting plane at height 5 inches is 8 - 5 = 3 inches below the cone's base.\n\nTo find the cone's height: Using the Pythagorean theorem with radius 6 and slant height 10:\n$h^2 + 6^2 = 10^2$\n$h^2 + 36 = 100$\n$h^2 = 64$\n$h = 8$ inches\n\nThe cone extends from height 8 to height 16 inches.

Since we know $a = 16$ and $b = 12$, we can use the fact that the area can be calculated using Heron's formula, but it's easier to use the constraint that all three area expressions must equal 96.\n\nFrom the area formula: $96 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot c \\cdot h_c$\nSo $c \\cdot h_c = 192$\n\nWe need another relationship to find $c$. Using the Law of Cosines and the fact that we know two sides and can find the angle between them from the area:\n\nThe area can also be expressed as $\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin C = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 16 \\cdot 12 \\cdot \\sin C = 96$\nThis gives us $96\\sin C = 96$, so $\\sin C = 1$, meaning $C = 90°$.\n\nSince triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle with the right angle at $C$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 16^2 + 12^2 = 256 + 144 = 400$\nSo $c = 20$.\n\nTherefore: $h_c = \\frac{192}{c} = \\frac{192}{20} = \\frac{48}{5}$",

The rhetorical structure moves from identifying the problem (flawed discourse) to explaining its consequences (obscuring real issues) to proposing a solution (reclaiming agency in AI governance).",

Dr. Chen emphasizes the cooling effect of evapotranspiration—the process by which plants release water vapor—while Dr. Rodriguez's study demonstrates this principle in practice by showing that neighborhoods with more tree coverage have lower temperatures. The texts complement each other: Chen provides the theoretical mechanism (evapotranspiration as natural air conditioning), and Rodriguez provides empirical evidence (tree coverage correlating with cooler temperatures). Both highlight vegetation as a significant cooling factor that has been underappreciated in urban heat island discussions.",

      "explanation": {
        "correctExplanation": "Choice A is correct because 'who' is the appropriate relative pronoun to use when referring to a person (the artist) in the subject position of the relative clause. The relative pronoun 'who' serves as the subject of the verb 'was' in the clause 'who was constantly revising and improving his initial concepts.' This construction follows standard English conventions for relative pronoun usage with human antecedents in subject position.",
        "wrongAnswerExplanations": {
          "A": "'Whom' is incorrect here because it is the object form of the relative pronoun, but the relative pronoun serves as the subject of the clause 'was constantly revising.' 'Whom' should only be used when the relative pronoun functions as an object.",
          "D": "'Which' is incorrect because it refers to things or animals, not people. When the antecedent is a person, standard English requires 'who' or 'whom,' not 'which.'",
          "C": "While 'that' can sometimes refer to people in restrictive relative clauses, it is less preferred in formal writing when 'who' is available, and in this context, 'who' is the more appropriate and conventional choice for referring to the artist as a person."
