You've put in the practice. You know the content. Now it's time to execute on test day. Here's everything you need to know to perform your best when it counts.

## The Night Before

What you do the night before matters more than you might think.

**Stop studying by 6 PM.** Cramming the night before doesn't help and can actually hurt. Your brain needs time to consolidate what you've learned, not process new information.

**Lay out everything you need:**
- Photo ID (required)
- Printed admission ticket
- Approved calculator (backup if you have one)
- Pencils/pens
- Snacks for the break
- Water bottle
- Comfortable layers (testing rooms vary in temperature)
- Watch (phones not allowed)

**Eat a normal dinner.** Don't try anything new or heavy. Stick to foods you know work for you.

**Set two alarms.** Really. One on your phone, one on an actual alarm clock. This is not the morning to oversleep.

**Get to bed at your normal time.** Trying to sleep extra-early often backfires—you'll just lie awake. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep at your regular schedule.

<Tip title="Sleep Anxiety Is Normal">
If you have trouble falling asleep, don't panic. One night of imperfect sleep won't ruin your score. Your adrenaline will carry you through. The worst thing you can do is stress about not sleeping—that makes it worse.
</Tip>

## Test Morning

Wake up with enough time to not feel rushed. Stress from running late can affect your whole test.

**Eat breakfast.** Your brain needs fuel. Protein and complex carbs are ideal—eggs, oatmeal, whole grain toast. Avoid sugar crashes from sugary cereals or pastries.

**Light physical activity.** A short walk or some stretches can wake up your body and reduce nervous energy.

**Arrive early.** Get to the test center at least 30 minutes before the start time. You'll need time to check in, find your room, and settle.

**Use the bathroom before you sit down.** You can leave during the test, but it costs you time.

## Managing Test Anxiety

Some nervousness is normal—even helpful. It means you care. But too much anxiety can hurt performance. Here's how to manage it:

**Deep breathing works.** Before the test starts, take 5 slow, deep breaths. Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4. This activates your parasympathetic nervous system and calms you down.

**Reframe your thoughts.** Instead of "I'm so nervous," try "I'm excited and ready." Your body can't tell the difference between anxiety and excitement—you can choose the label.

**Focus on the present question.** Anxiety comes from thinking about outcomes. The cure is to focus entirely on the question in front of you. One question at a time.

<Warning title="Don't Judge Your Performance During the Test">
You'll likely have a few questions that feel hard. That's normal—and it doesn't mean you're doing poorly. The adaptive test adjusts difficulty. Trust your preparation and keep going.
</Warning>

**If panic hits:** Put down your pencil, close your eyes, and take 10 slow breaths. It's better to lose 30 seconds calming down than to rush through questions while panicked.

## During the Test: Timing Strategies

The digital SAT shows you a timer. Use it wisely.

**First module of each section:** Pace yourself to finish with 2-3 minutes to spare. You need time to review flagged questions.

**Check in at the halfway point:** At the midpoint of each module, you should be at or ahead of schedule. If you're significantly behind, speed up slightly.

**Flag and move on:** If a question is taking too long, flag it and move on. Return to flagged questions only after completing the section.

**Don't leave blanks:** There's no penalty for guessing. If time is running out, make sure every question has an answer—even if it's a guess.

## The Break

You get a 10-minute break between the Reading/Writing and Math sections. Use it wisely:

- **Use the bathroom** (even if you don't think you need to)
- **Eat your snack** (something with protein and moderate sugar—nuts, a banana, crackers)
- **Drink water** (dehydration impairs cognitive function)
- **Move around** (stand up, stretch, walk a bit)
- **Don't discuss questions** (it creates anxiety and can get you in trouble)

<Tip>
Don't look at your phone during the break, even if it's allowed. Seeing texts or social media can be distracting. Stay in test mode.
</Tip>

## Strategic Guessing

You should never leave a question blank, but there's a strategy to guessing:

**Eliminate first.** Even eliminating one wrong answer improves your odds from 25% to 33%. Two eliminations give you 50% odds.

**For total guesses:** If you truly can't eliminate anything, pick one letter (say, C) and use it for all your random guesses. This ensures you'll get some right by chance.

**Trust your instincts:** Studies show that first instincts are often correct. Don't change answers unless you have a clear reason.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Spending too long on hard questions:** Your time is limited. A hard question is worth the same as an easy one. Don't let one question eat 5 minutes.

**Changing answers without reason:** "I always change and get it wrong" is a real phenomenon. Only change if you find a concrete error.

**Rushing the last questions:** Some students panic at the end and rush. Those last questions are worth just as many points. Steady pace, not fast finish.

**Misreading questions:** In your rush, it's easy to miss key words. "NOT," "EXCEPT," "least," etc. Underline these words mentally.

## After the Test

You did it. Here's what comes next:

**Don't analyze your performance obsessively.** You can't change anything now, and your memory of specific questions is unreliable.

**Don't discuss questions with others.** It only creates anxiety, especially if you remember things differently.

**Scores come in about two weeks.** Set a reminder and then forget about it. Go celebrate your hard work.

**If you're unhappy with your score:** You can retake the SAT. Many students improve significantly on their second attempt. This is a journey, not a single moment.
