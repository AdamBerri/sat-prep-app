Here's a truth that every top scorer knows: the SAT isn't about being naturally gifted. It's about showing up, day after day, and putting in the work.

## The Compound Effect of Daily Practice

Think about it like building muscle. You don't go to the gym once for 10 hours and expect to be ripped. You go for 30 minutes, five days a week, for months. Your brain works the same way.

When you practice SAT questions consistently:

- Your pattern recognition improves automatically
- You start seeing question "types" before you even finish reading them
- Time pressure becomes less stressful because the material feels familiar
- Your confidence builds with every correct answer

<Tip title="The 20-Minute Rule">
Can't find time to study? You don't need hours. Just 20 minutes of focused practice per day adds up to over 120 hours of prep over six months. That's more effective than cramming for a weekend.

## Why Cramming Doesn't Work

We've all been there. Test is next week, panic sets in, and suddenly you're doing 8-hour study sessions. Here's why that backfires:

**Cognitive overload is real.** Your brain can only process and retain so much new information at once. After about 45 minutes of intense focus, your retention drops dramatically.

**Sleep is when learning happens.** When you cram, you sacrifice sleep. But sleep is when your brain consolidates what you learned during the day. No sleep = no retention.

**Stress kills performance.** Cramming creates anxiety. Anxiety impairs your working memory—the exact thing you need for the SAT. You're literally making yourself worse at the test.

## The Science of Spaced Repetition

There's a reason 1600Club resurfaces topics you've struggled with. It's called spaced repetition, and it's one of the most well-researched learning techniques in cognitive science.

Here's how it works:

1. You encounter a concept and get it wrong
2. We show you the explanation
3. A few days later, we bring it back
4. If you get it right, we wait longer before showing it again
5. If you get it wrong, we show it sooner

This method ensures you're always working at the edge of your ability—not too easy, not too hard. That's where real learning happens.

Students who use spaced repetition techniques score an average of 100+ points higher than those who study the same material in massed sessions.

## Building the Habit

The hardest part isn't the studying—it's making studying a habit. Here's what works:

**Same time, same place.** Your brain loves routines. Study at the same time each day, in the same spot. After a few weeks, your brain will automatically switch into "study mode" when you sit down.

**Start laughably small.** Want to study for an hour? Start with 5 minutes. Seriously. The goal isn't to be productive on day one—it's to build the habit. You can always do more once you're sitting down.

**Track your streak.** There's something powerful about not wanting to break a streak. Use our progress tracking to see your daily practice visualized. Let that green streak motivate you.

**Celebrate small wins.** Got a question right that you would have missed last week? That's progress. Acknowledge it. Your brain responds to positive reinforcement.

## What Consistency Looks Like

Let's be concrete. A consistent SAT prep routine might look like:

- **Monday-Friday:** 20-30 minutes of practice questions
- **Saturday:** One full practice section (timed)
- **Sunday:** Review your wrong answers from the week

That's it. No 4-hour sessions. No weekend marathons. Just steady, sustainable progress.

## The Bottom Line

You don't need to be a genius to score high on the SAT. You need to be consistent. Every question you practice, every explanation you read, every mistake you learn from—it all compounds.

The students who get 1500+ aren't the ones who were born smart. They're the ones who showed up, day after day, and trusted the process.

You can do this. Start today. Start small. But most importantly: keep showing up.
